            <p> I was born in Seoul, South Korea. I was a girl who loves everything. Loves playing sports, musical instruments, drawing, learning a second language, and even math. I studied everything that I love. When I was 17 years old, I decided on my pathway to graphic design. Reason? I can't remember, but one thing for sure is that I fell in love with the visual communication design exhibition at Chicago cultural center in 2018.

            <p> In 2020, I was accepted into SAIC. I majored in the Visual communication department. Making books, posters, and website UI/UX, I am learning lots of techniques in SAIC until now.
